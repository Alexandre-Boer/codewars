Codewars problem:

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"
dnaStrand []        `shouldBe` []
dnaStrand [A,T,G,C] `shouldBe` [T,A,C,G]
dnaStrand [G,T,A,T] `shouldBe` [C,A,T,A]
dnaStrand [A,A,A,A] `shouldBe` [T,T,T,T]

'''

dna = 'ATTGC'

def DNA_strand(dna):
    my_dict = {'T':'A', 'C':'G'}
    my_string = ''
    for letter in dna:
        for key, value in my_dict.items():
            if letter == key:
                my_string += value
            elif letter == value:
                my_string += key
    return my_string

print(DNA_strand(dna))
